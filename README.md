# Azure Functions Python Extensions

This repository is for the active development of the Azure Functions extensions for the Python worker. 
For consumers of these extensions we recommend 
visiting our [public developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/azure/).

## Getting started

For your convenience, each binding type has a separate library that you can choose to use instead of one, 
large Azure package. To get started with a specific library, see the `README.md` (or `README.rst`) file located 
in the library's project folder.

### Prerequisites

The libraries are supported on Function Apps using Python 3.7 or later. For more details, please read our page on 
[Python Functions version support policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions?tabs=isolated-process%2Cv4&pivots=programming-language-python#languages).

## SDK Support
