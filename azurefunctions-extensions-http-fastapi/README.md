## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or later is required to use this package. For more details, please read our page on [Python Functions version support policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions?tabs=isolated-process%2Cv4&pivots=programming-language-python#languages).


### Instructions
1. Follow the guide to [create an app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-python?tabs=windows%2Cbash%2Cazure-cli%2Cbrowser).
2. Ensure your app is using programming model v2 and contains a http trigger function.
3. Add ```azurefunctions-extensions-http-fastapi``` to your requirements.txt
4. Import Request and different types of responses from ```azurefunctions.extensions.http.fastapi``` in your HttpTrigger functions.
5. Change the request and response types to ones imported from ```azurefunctions.extensions.http.fastapi```.
6. Run your function app and try it out!

### Bind to the FastApi-type
The Azure Functions Extensions Http FastApi library for Python allows you to create a function app with FastApi Request or Response types. When your function runs, you will receive the request of FastApi Request type and you can return a FastApi response type instance. FastApi is one of top popular python web framework which provides elegant and powerful request/response types and functionalities to users. With this integration, you are empowered to use request/response the same way as using them in native FastApi. A good example is you can do http streaming upload and streaming download now! Feel free to check out [Fastapi doc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/responses/?h=custom) for further reference. 


```python
# This Azure Function receives streaming data from a client and processes it in real-time.
# It demonstrates streaming upload capabilities for scenarios such as uploading large files,
# processing continuous data streams, or handling IoT device data.

import azure.functions as func
from azurefunctions.extensions.http.fastapi import Request, JSONResponse

app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)

@app.route(route="streaming_upload", methods=[func.HttpMethod.POST])
async def streaming_upload(req: Request) -> JSONResponse:
    """Handle streaming upload requests."""
    # Process each chunk of data as it arrives
    async for chunk in req.stream():
        process_data_chunk(chunk)

    # Once all data is received, return a JSON response indicating successful processing
    return JSONResponse({"status": "Data uploaded and processed successfully"})

def process_data_chunk(chunk: bytes):
    """Process each data chunk."""
    # Add custom processing logic here
    pass
```
